# Day 54

## Python backends

Flask, Django are the most popular Python frameworks

Flask - beginners and smaller projects
Django - larger more complicated projects

### Client

Client side is the part that faces the user

### Server

Powerful computer hooked up to internet that is always ready to get requests.

### Database

Storing all the information related to the website.

For example, when user goes to www.google.com, they type it into the url bar, it gets sent to server as a request. This goes across the internet to another computer, and the server needs to respond.

Server response by sending over the html, css and js files for that website. This can then be rendered by browser by the webpage.

### Installing packages

1. Red lightbulb
2. In PyCharm Preferences > Project
3. Install with pip in Terminal 
   4. pip allows us to install any package from pypi.org 
   5. Terminal > pip install Flask

## Command Line

Terminal is also referred to as the command line or shell. Let's think about a Pistachio nut, the kernel (that you will eat) is the actual program that interfaces with the hardware.

The shell is the human interface that you can interact. There is a GUI shell (like a finder) but there is also a command line interface.

Why use the command line? Greater control.

```
pwd = print working directory (find where I am)
ls = list the files and folders at the current working directory
cd name_of_folder = change directory (i.e. cd Desktop)
cd .. = moving up one folder
mkdir name_of_folder = make directory
touch name_of_file = create new file inside current working directory
rm name_of_file = remove file
rm -rf name_of_folder = remove folder. -rf is recursively deleting so it is very powerful
```
